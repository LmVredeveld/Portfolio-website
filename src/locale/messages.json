    "2789173937937850091": "Hello! My name is Lorenzo and I started my programming journey in 2020. Let me explain all by going back to December 2020. That month a lot changed in my life, since I moved to Argentina. It all started when a company here in Cordoba, Argentina became interested in me and ended up hiring me as a second-level support agent. The type of work that was included in this position was the creation of queries for a SQL database, finding out why a query is slow and improving it. It also included localizing bugs that customers or we found and trying to find a solution that would resolve them. This code was written in C# and was not easy to understand for someone that just started. However, I had a good supervisor that helped me a lot, being these my very first steps into programming. One year later, in December 2021, my passion for programming made me switch paths, and that is when I started to work at Globant, as a web UI trainee. Before that, I had never worked with HTML CSS and JS, so entering this level made a lot of sense. Now fast forwarding to today, I got promoted to web UI JR, and I'm enjoying what I'm doing every day, trying to learn as much as I can. i have been working with globant more than 1 year and a half learning react.js and also other frameworks and librarys.
